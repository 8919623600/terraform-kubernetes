### In k8's, labels and selectors are very important
### Main goal of the replica-set is to ensure the mentioend number of pods running all the time

### Remember once a resource is created, you cannot update any value apart from the image , replicas.
### Any changes apart from those 2 needs to be created as a brand new resource.
